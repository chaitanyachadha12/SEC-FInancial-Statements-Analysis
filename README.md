# SEC-FInancial-Statements-Analysis

## Introduction

The Financial Statement Data Set is a comprehensive resource created by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to facilitate the analysis and consumption of financial data submitted by public companies. This dataset is derived from the EX-101 attachments to various filings, which utilize the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) to present structured financial information.

## Key Features of the Dataset
The dataset includes quarterly and annual numeric data from primary financial statements, which encompass:

1. Balance Sheet
2. IncomeStatement
3. CashFlowStatement
4. Changesin Equity
5. Comprehensive Income

## Structure
The dataset consists of four key components:

1. **Submission Data Set (SUB)**: Contains records for each XBRL submission, providing essential information about the filing entity and the submission itself.

2. **Number Data Set (NUM)**: Includes individual numeric values reported in the primary financial statements, detailing every line item from each submission.

3. **Tag Data Set (TAG)**: Provides metadata about the tags used in the submissions, including documentation labels, taxonomy versions, and tag attributes.

4. **Presentation Data Set (PRE)**: Offers insights into how tags and corresponding numbers were presented in the financial statements, including their sequence and structure.

**Update Frequency**: The Financial Statement Data Set is updated quarterly, incorporating data from filings submitted after the close of business on the last day of the quarter. This ensures users have access to the most recent financial information available.
